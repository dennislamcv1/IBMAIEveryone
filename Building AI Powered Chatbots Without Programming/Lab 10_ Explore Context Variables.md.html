    <h5>Lab 10: Explore Context Variables</h5>
    <p>Objective for Exercise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to use context variables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By now you know the essentials of chatbot building. There are however more advanced
      concepts that will enable you to create better and smarter chatbots.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could list them all here at once, but I think it makes more sense to organically introduce them
      as their need arises in the process of improving our chatbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that some of these concepts are tougher to get, particularly if you have no prior
      programming experience. So, don't be discouraged if you don't fully get everything right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can try things out, test to see if they work, and if they don't, try something else. That's why
      the <em>Try it out</em> panel is so useful. It allows you to build chatbots one feature at the time. Stick
      with it, and if you practice, you'll quickly become familiar with the advanced concepts as well.
    </p>
    <h2>Exercise 1: Remember the city with context variables</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever a user enters a new input, the intent and entities that are detected don't stick
      around for the rest of the conversation. They exist at the moment, for the current input, and
      are forgotten once the user types more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is generally fine, but it limits the chatbot's ability to appear smarter and remembering the
      context of the conversation so far. For example, consider the following interaction.
    </p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module6/images/1.png" width="600">
    <p>
      A human customer care agent responding to the second question would have inferred that the
      user is asking about the hours of operation for the city they just inquired about in the previous
      question (i.e., Toronto).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the entity detected in the first input only lives for the duration of that input, so our
      chatbot has no memory of it when the user enters a second question.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we store this information so that it’s available for the duration of the conversation?
      Enter the concept of context variables, which allow us to do just that. As we go about collecting
      information from the user, we can store it in the <strong>Context</strong> and then reuse it when it makes
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to achieve this is to create a passthrough node that checks for the <em>@ location</em> entity
      and sets it to the <em>$city</em> context variable if one is detected. It then jumps to the next node in the
      dialog and hands off the execution to the rest of the nodes as if this node didn't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that this is not necessarily the best approach, but it allows us to demonstrate a
      couple of things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The passthrough node technique which can come in handy in complex chatbots;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How context variables work.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, let's see how this would work in practice.</p>
    <h3>Creating a passthrough node</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In the <em>Dialog</em> section of your skill, select the <em>Welcome</em> node more options menu, and **click</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Add node below** to create a sibling node underneath (as a reminder, all nodes must be
      contained between the <em>Welcome</em> and the <em>Anything else</em> node).
    </p>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Call the node Assign City or something similar. **Set the condition to <em>@ location</em>. Delete the</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      response by clicking on the trash can icon in the response area**, as we don't want this node to
      issue the response, only to set the variable in the context.
    </p>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Next click on the more options menu to the right of <em>Assistant responds</em> and **select *Open</li>
    </ol>
    <p>context editor***.</p>
    <ol start="4">
      <li>You'll be offered the ability to set one or more context variables whenever this node is</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      executed. <strong>Enter city for the variable name, and @ location for the value</strong>, as shown in the
      figure below.
    </p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module6/images/2.png" width="600">
    <p>
      In the <em>Then assistant should</em> section we don't want to wait for the user input (they already gave
      us input to process) we just want to jump to the rest of the nodes as if nothing happened. To do
      so <strong>select <em>Jump to</em> from the drop-down list</strong>. You'll be asked to specify which node to jump to.
      <strong>Select the first node just below the current one</strong>(i.e., Hours of Operation).
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll then be asked to specify what to do after the jump. Wait for the user input? No. Respond
      directly? No. <strong>Select is <em>If assistant recognizes (condition)</em></strong> so that this node can be evaluated as it
      normally would.
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Assign City</em> now is now ready and can be closed.</p>
    <p>
      To recap, our node detects if there is a <em>@ location</em> specified in the input. If there is, we execute
      the node which does nothing but set the context variable <em>$city</em> to the entity value (e.g.,
      Vancouver).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we jump to evaluating the condition of the first node beneath us so that the flow is the
      same as if the <em>Assign City</em> node wasn't there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that node's condition is successful it will be executed. If not, the nodes beneath will be
      evaluated in their order of appearance. If none of the nodes satisfy the current input, we hit the
      fallback <em>Anything else</em> node as usual.
    </p>
    <p>Your <em>Assign City</em> node should look as shown in the image below.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module6/images/3.png" width="600">
    <ol start="5">
      <li>Head over to the <em>Try it out panel</em>, click <em>Clear</em>, and ask **What are your hours of</li>
    </ol>
    <p>operation?**</p>
    <p>
      Click on <em>Manage Context</em> at the top of the panel to see the content of the <em>Context</em> (i.e., its
      variables). The <em>$timezone</em> variable will already be set for you automatically, but because we
      didn't specify a location, the <em>Assign City</em> node was not executed, and therefore no <em>$city</em> context
      variable was set.
    </p>
    <ol start="6">
      <li>Close the context and now **try entering What are your hours of operation in</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Montreal?** in input. Next, click on <em>Manage Context</em> again. You'll notice that this time the <em>$city</em>
      context variable has been set to the entity value (i.e., the string <em>"Montreal"</em>).
    </p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module6/images/4.png" width="600">
    <p>
      We'll have access to this variable for the entire duration of the conversation with the user (or
      until we set its value to something else). It's worth noting that pressing <em>Clear</em> in the <em>Try it out</em>
      panel starts a new conversation, and so context variables are cleared as well. Go ahead and
      close the context manager again.
    </p>
    <ol start="7">
      <li>We want to make sure that <em>$city</em> variable is set whether it was specified along with a request</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      for hours information (as we already did) or for location addresses. So as a sanity check, <strong>try
where is your Calgary store?</strong>. You should see that the city in the context now changes to
      the string <em>"Calgary"</em>.
    </p>
    <ol start="8">
      <li>Alright, we now store the city in our trusty <em>$city</em> context variable. To make use of it, we'll</li>
    </ol>
    <p>need to change our <em>Our Locations</em> child nodes under the <em>Hours of Operation and Location
Information parent nodes</em>. We need to do so both in the condition and in the responses.</p>
    <p>
      There is an easy way to do this. <strong>Simply replace <em>@ location</em> with <em>$city</em> for every occurrence</strong> in
      the two <em>Our Locations</em> child nodes as I did in the image below.
    </p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module6/images/5.png" width="600">
    <p><strong>Make sure you repeat this process for both <em>Our Locations</em> child nodes.</strong></p>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-stata">Please <span class="hljs-keyword">note</span> that <span class="hljs-variable">$city</span>:Vancouver (<span class="hljs-keyword">no</span> spaces) is just a shorthand <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$city</span> == <span class="hljs-string">"Vancouver"</span>.
<span class="hljs-keyword">If</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">one</span> of our cities contained a space, we’<span class="hljs-keyword">d</span> need to <span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> the == comparison (<span class="hljs-keyword">e</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">g</span>., <span class="hljs-variable">$city</span> ==
<span class="hljs-string">"Quebec City"</span>).
</code></pre>
    <ol start="9">
      <li>Next, test the original interaction again. As a reminder, you can save time by recalling</li>
    </ol>
    <p>previous input through the <em>Up</em> key on your keyboard, instead of retyping the same questions in.</p>
    <p><strong>Enter, what's the address of your store in Toronto?</strong> followed by <strong>ok, what are its
hours?</strong> You should now see a better response as shown in the image below!</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module6/images/6.png" width="600">
    <p>The chatbot definitely comes across as smarter and it's more useful to the end-user.</p>
    <ol start="10">
      <li>But wait... now that we have the <em>$city</em> variable, can we use it to help our business even</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      further? It would be a nice touch to tell the user we hope they'll visit our store when they wave
      us goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply <strong>change the <em>Goodbyes</em> node responses to include the <em>$city</em> variable.</strong> If it's set to a
      specific city, it will be shown. If it's not set, it will not be displayed. So, go ahead and change the
      first response for that node to:
    </p>
    <p>Nice talking to you today. We hope you visit our <em>$city</em> store.</p>
    <p>If the <em>$city</em> is set to, say, <em>Calgary</em>, the response to the user will be <em>Nice talking to you today. We
hope you visit our Calgary store</em>. If no city is set, simply <em>Nice talking to you today</em>. <em>We hope you
visit our store</em>. A small, but still nice touch that invites our customers to shop with us.</p>
    <p>Now replace the other two goodbyes with variations such as:</p>
    <p>We hope you visit our $city store. Have a nice day.</p>
    <p>Nice talking to you today. We hope to see you at our $city store.</p>
    <p>
      Go ahead and <strong>test that it works in the <em>Try it out</em> panel</strong>. Next, click on the <em>Clear</em> link at the top to
      clear your variables and try typing bye now that no context variable is set. You should see that
      the response still makes sense.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-livecodeserver">As <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> general rule, always <span class="hljs-built_in">clear</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> context whenever you are running <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> test.
</code></pre>
    <p>Context variables are quite useful, as I hope this small example allowed to illustrate.</p>
    <h3>Exercise 2: Collect the user name with<!--? input.text ?--></h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes you'll see chatbots asking for the user name to make the interaction more
      personable. We know that we'd want to store it in a context variable once we acquire it so that
      we can refer to it throughout the conversation to sound more friendly. However, how would
      we go about collecting the name?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, we could use a <em>@ sys-person</em> entity that would detect names for us. However, this
      wasn’t a very robust solution and it failed to detect the beautiful variety of names in existence.
      It is now deprecated and cannot use it. So we’ll have to roll our own solution.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the <em>Welcome</em> node. We need to change the prompt so that it asks for a name. **Enter,</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hello, my name is Florence and I'm a chatbot. What name can I call you by?**</p>
    <ol start="2">
      <li><strong>We need a child node to actually collect the name</strong> (the answer to our question, in other</li>
    </ol>
    <p>words). <strong>So, go ahead and create a child node under <em>Welcome</em>.</strong> Call it Collect Name.</p>
    <p>We want to always execute this child node after the prompt, so <strong>set its condition to true</strong>.</p>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Watson stores the current user input in input.text. So open the context editor (from the</li>
    </ol>
    <p>more options icon to the right of <em>Assistant responds</em>) for this new node and <strong>set
the <em>name</em> context variable to <!--? input.text ?-->.</strong></p>
    <p>The reason why we need the special syntax is that we don't want to literally say <em>Nice to meet
you input.text.</em> but rather we are asking Watson to give us the actual value of the variable.</p>
    <p>Doing so will collect the user input and assign it to the name.</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-livecodeserver">If you want <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> always capitalize <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> name, so that antonio is stored <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> Antonio, you can use <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span>
bit <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> code <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">replace</span> <span class="hljs-meta">&#x3C;?</span> input.<span class="hljs-keyword">text</span> <span class="hljs-meta">?></span> <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span>:

This will capitalize <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> letter <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> user reply <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> you. If you are <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> programmer, don<span class="hljs-string">'t
worry too much about the details. Simply know that it capitalizes the input text and you can
copy and paste it whenever you have such a need in your chatbots.
</span></code></pre>
    <p>For the response, you can <strong>use the response below:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Nice to meet you, $name. How can I help you? You can ask me about our store
      hours, locations, or flower recommendations.
    </p>
    <p>The image below shows what the node should look like.</p>
    <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CB0103EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module6/images/7.png" width="600">
    <p>
      Finally, test out a complete conversation with the chatbot entering these, one at the time (after
      clicking <em>Clear</em> in the <em>Try it out</em> panel to start a brand new conversation:
    </p>
    <p>(enter your name after the prompt)</p>
    <p>What are your hours of operation of your Toronto store?</p>
    <p>Where is it?</p>
    <p>Thank you</p>
    <p>Goodbye</p>
    <p>Pretty neat, right? If it worked, congratulations on completing Lab 10.</p>
    <h6>Help! It didn't work.</h6>
    <pre><code class="hljs language-kotlin">You can skip <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span> section <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> the conversation above worked well <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> your chatbot.
</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the conversation above didn't work well for your chatbot, it's likely because some mistake (or
      happy little accidents as Bob Ross would have called them) was made in the process of
      following the instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that's the case, no worries, you can import <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/acangiano/dd03853cc7edb66f0a1384c7e87f5999/raw/d2458a6742f24a5297dadc75a02d49fef3c9a4b9/flower-shop-skill.json?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&#x26;utm_source=Exinfluencer&#x26;utm_content=000026UJ&#x26;utm_term=10006555&#x26;utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkCB0103ENSkillsNetwork20718357-2022-01-01" target="_blank" rel="external">this JSON file</a>with the current chatbot we built so far.

      automatically downloading it (Ctrl+S on Windows and Command+S on Mac). Feel free to call it
      Flower-Shop-Skill.json or something like that.
    </p>
    <p>You can then click on the <em>Dialog</em> section of your Watson Assistant instance, expand <em>Options</em> and click on <em>Upload/Download</em>.</p>
